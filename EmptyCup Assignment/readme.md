# 3D Solar System Simulation

> **Assignment for EmptyCup Frontend Developer Role**

This project is an interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). You can view the planets orbiting the sun, adjust their speeds, zoom in/out, toggle between light and dark themes, and pause/play the animation.

## Features

- **3D Visualization:** Realistic orbits and planet sizes (not to scale).
- **Zoom In/Out:** Use the buttons to zoom the camera.
- **Pause/Play:** Pause or resume the planetary motion.
- **Reset Speeds:** Instantly reset all planet speeds to their defaults.
- **Adjust Speeds:** Use sliders to change the orbital speed of each planet.
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between dark and light backgrounds for the whole page and scene.
- **Planet Orbits:** Visual orbit rings for each planet.
- **Hover Labels:** Hover over a planet to see its name.

## How to Use

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. Use the controls on the right to:
   - Zoom in/out
   - Pause or play the animation
   - Reset all planet speeds
   - Toggle between dark and light themes
   - Adjust the speed of each planet using the sliders
3. Hover your mouse over any planet in the scene to see its name.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` â€” Main HTML file containing all JavaScript and markup.
- Uses [Three.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js) via CDN.

## Developer Notes

- All logic and rendering are handled in `index.html` for simplicity.
- No external CSS or JS files are required.
- The code is commented for clarity and easy modification.
- The simulation is not to scale and is for educational/demonstration purposes.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- No installation or build step required.

## Credits

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering.
